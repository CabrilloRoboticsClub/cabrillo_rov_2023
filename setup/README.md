# Setup

This readme will describe how to setup various things.

## Development Box Setup 

Take the following steps to get started. 

1. Install necessary packages (skip this if you're using a removable drive provided by the club)
    ```console
    $ sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install -y git ansible python3-pip vim 
    ```
1. Create an SSH key if you don't have one already. 
    ```console 
    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    ```
    Use the default location, set a password if you like. 
1. Copy and paste your public key into GitHub
    ```console
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```
1. Check out this repository into your home directory. 
    ```console
    $ cd 
    $ git clone git@github.com:CabrilloRoboticsClub/cabrillo_rov_2023.git
    $ cd ~/cabrillo_rov_2023
    $ git submodule init 
    $ git submodule update
    ```
1. Use `make` to install ROS2 and all the necessary packages. 
    ```console 
    $ make devbox-install
    ```
    This will take a while! 
1. Put ROS on your path 
    ```console
    echo 'if [ -z "$ROS_DISTRO"]; then source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash; fi' >> ~/.bashrc 
    ```
1. **Start a new shell** and build the repository
    ```console
    $ make 
    ```

## Raspberry Pi (ROV) Setup Procedure

Start by creating a bootable SD card image: 

1. On your local computer download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
1. Attach a Micro SD card to your local computer
1. Open Raspberry Pi Imager
    * `CHOOSE OS` > `Other general-purpose OS` > `Ubuntu` > `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (64-bit)`
    * Choose the Micro SD card as the storage and hit `WRITE`
1. Unplug the Micro SD card from your local computer, plug it back in to your local computer.
1. Copy the `user-data` file from `setup/image` into the `system-boot` volume that shows up (overwrite the existing file).
1. Install the SD card into the Raspberry Pi
1. Connect the Pi to an ethernet connection with internet access
1. Plug the power cable in to the Pi.

The Pi will boot, then reboot. Give it 10 minutes or so. The hostname and passwords are now set. SSH is enabled. You can connect with:

```console
$ ssh -A ubuntu@seahawk.local
```

Once you have SSHed into the new Pi image run the ROV specific playbooks:

1. Check out this repository into your home directory. 
    ```console
    $ cd 
    $ git clone git@github.com:CabrilloRoboticsClub/cabrillo_rov_2023.git
    $ cd ~/cabrillo_rov_2023
    $ git submodule init 
    $ git submodule update
    ```
1. Install make and Ansible command
    ```console
    $ sudo apt install make ansible
    ```
1. Use `make` to install ROS2 and all the necessary packages. 
    ```console 
    $ make rov-install
    ```
    **This will take a long, long time!** 30 minutes or more. 
1. Reboot the Pi 
    ```console
    $ sudo reboot
    ```
1. Disable the building of the `seahawk_description` package 
    ```console 
    $ touch src/seahawk_description/COLCON_IGNORE 
    ```
1. Put ROS on your path 
    ```console
    echo 'if [ -z "$ROS_DISTRO"]; then source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash; fi' >> ~/.bashrc 
    ```
1. **Start a new shell** and build the repository
    ```console
    $ make 
    ```
