# Style Guidelines

Adhering to a standard style guide is important for code constancy across the project. Consistency in style makes code easier to read and understand by all collaborators on the project, and makes the final result more cohesive.
The [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-annotations) is a good place to start for information about correct style practices. Below are some specific guidelines to follow

## 1 Comments
### 1.1 File docstring
All files should begin with the following comment where `<file_name.py>` is the name of the file and `<description>` is a short summary of its purpose.
```py
"""
<file_name.py>

<Description>

"""
``` 
### 1.2 Class docstring
The beginning of a user defined class should contain a comment describing its purpose
#### Example:
```py
class TabWidget(qtw.QWidget):
    """
    Creates a 'TabWidget' which inherits from the 'qtw.QWidget' class. 
    A 'TabWidget' provides a tab bar and a page area that is used to display pages 
    related to each tab. The tab bar is shown above the page area. Each tab is 
    associated with a different widget called a page. Only the current page is shown 
    in the page area; all the other pages are hidden. The user can show a different 
    page by clicking on its tab
    """
    # Class definition here
```

### 1.3 Function docstrings
Doc strings provide information about a user defined function. Every function should contain a doc string which adheres to the following format:
```py
"""
A short summary of the function's purpose

Args:
    arg_1: Description
    arg_2: Description

Returns:
    Description of what the function returns
"""
```
#### Example:
```py
def get_minimum_current_scalar(self, mv: list) -> float:
    """
    Returns a scalar which shows the maximum amount of thrust the robot can 
    produce for the given direction without exceeding total current (A) limits, 
    or the current (A) limit of either ESC

    Args:
        mv: The motor values in newtons that when produced will result in
            our desired twist

    Returns:
        The largest scalar we can scale those motor values by without exceeding the 
        total current (A) limit and the current limit of each ESC
    """
    # Function definition here
```
Note, the `self` param does not need to be described in the list of arguments

### 1.4 Single line comments 
Single line comments should especially be added to parts of code who's purpose is not clear upon first glance.

#### Example good use of comments:
```py
# Enable terminal raw mode. In raw mode characters are directly 
# read from and written to the device without any translation or
# interpretation by the operating system
tty.setraw(sys.stdin.fileno())
```
Explains code which may not be easily understandable without further research. 

#### Example unnessicary use of comments:
```py
# Using the addition operator, compute the sum of two numbers: 'a' and 'b'.
# Store the result of the computation in a variable called 'sum'
sum = a + b
```
Code which is self explanatory and does not need a comment

## 2 Naming conventions

### 2.1 File names
Files should be named using `snake_case`. `snake_case` is a naming convention in which spaces are replaced with underscores and all letters are lowercase.
#### Example
```sh
pilot_input.py
```

### 2.2 Class names
Classes should be named using `PascalCase`. `PascalCase` is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word is capitalized. Note that this differs from camelCase because the first letter is also capitalized.
#### Example:
```py
class SetRemoteParams():
    # Class definition here
```

### 2.3 Function names
Functions should be named using `snake_case`. `snake_case` is a naming convention in which spaces are replaced with underscores and all letters are lowercase.
#### Example:
```py
def get_current_scalar_value(self, mv: list, limit: float) -> float:
    # Function definition here
```

### 2.4 Variable names
Variables should generally be named using `snake_case`. `snake_case` is a naming convention in which spaces are replaced with underscores and all letters are lowercase.
#### Example:
```py
coef_list = self.get_polynomial_coef(mv, limit)
```

### 2.5 Constant variable names
Constants are variables which once set, do not change. Python does not enforce constants however constants can be denoted by the naming conventions. Constant variables should be named using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` is a naming convention in which spaces are replaced with underscores and all letters are uppercase.
#### Example:
```py
COLOR_CONSTS = {
    "MAIN_WIN_BKG"      : "#0c0c0f",
    "INACTIVE_TAB_BKG"  : "#141416",
    "INACTIVE_TAB_BD"   : "#2d2938",
    "ACTIVE_TAB_BKG"    : "#111113",
    "SURFACE_DRK"       : "#18181b",
    "SURFACE_BRIGHT"    : "#34343c",
    "ACCENT_LIGHT"      : "#9172f8",
    "ACCENT_DRK"        : "#5c4ba3",
    "PRIMARY_TEXT"      : "#fff0f5",
    "SECONDARY_TEXT"    : "#8f8c95",
}
```

### 2.6 Private class attributes
Private attributes are attributes of an object which can only be accessed and modified in the class itself. Python does not enforce private class attributes, however they can be denoted by the naming conventions. Python style standards advise using two leading underscores before a attribute name to denote it should be considered private.
#### Example:
```py
self.__track_state = 0b0000  
```
When creating a class for a ROS2 node, technically all member variables and functions should be private. However, since all attributes should be private to make the code cleaner for this project we have decided to **NOT** use leading double underscores within node classes.
#### Example:
```py
self.claw_pub = self.create_publisher(Bool, "claw_state", 10)
```
